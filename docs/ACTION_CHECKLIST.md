🎓 KEY LEARNINGS (From consciousness-bugs Review)
1. **Sequence Matters**: Build → Test → Debug → Track (not: Track → Build)
2. **"Done Enough" Is Valid**: 80% solution that exists > 100% solution delayed
3. **Priority Discipline**: LOW priority tasks are seductive but distract from HIGH priority work
4. **Premature Infrastructure**: Built bug tracker before having code to track bugs for

💖 MOTIVATION
