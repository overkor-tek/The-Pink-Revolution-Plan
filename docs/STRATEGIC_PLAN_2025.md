## 📝 Notes & Assumptions

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Single Primary Contributor (Claude)**: Initial phases assume Claude as primary developer, scaling to team as contributors join
2. **Existing Infrastructure**: Assumes current philosopher-ai-backend infrastructure is stable and can be pattern for others
3. **Tool Availability**: Tools like pink_revolution.py scanner are already built and functional
4. **Community Growth**: Assumes organic growth through quality work and good documentation
5. **No Major Blockers**: Assumes no catastrophic technical or organizational blockers

### Flexibility Points:
- **Timelines are aggressive but achievable** - can adjust based on reality
- **Quarterly reviews allow pivots** - not locked into annual plan
- **Priority matrix allows shifting** - can move tasks between quarters
- **Resource assumptions can change** - plan scales with contributor count

### Success Philosophy:
> "Better to complete 80% excellently than 100% mediocrely"

Focus on high-impact work, ship incrementally, iterate based on feedback, celebrate wins.
