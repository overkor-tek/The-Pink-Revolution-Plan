**CC:** [Caseworker supervisor, DCYF contacts]  
**Subject:** Visitation Scheduling Request - [Case No. 25-7-00234-39]

---

Dear [Attorney Name],

I am writing to request assistance in scheduling visitation with my son Eli this week.

I will be working in Sandpoint through [end date] and am available to accommodate visits around my schedule. I sent Eli a message on December 7, 2025, notifying him of my availability and requesting scheduling information.

Please advise on available times and location, or direct me to the appropriate contact for coordination.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Respectfully,  
Magz [Last Name]  
Pro Se Litigant  
[Phone]  
[Email]

---

**What this email does:**
- Documents Sunday outreach (before the 10th)
- States availability without over-explaining
- Puts the ball in their court
- Zero emotion, all business
- Creates paper trail with witnesses (the CCs)

---

# 📱 SOCIAL MEDIA EXECUTION PLAN

## Content Rules for the Week
1. **Always working, always building** - every post should show purpose
2. **No venting, no case details** - let the legal docs do the talking
3. **Tag each other** - builds the Overkor brand and shows unity
4. **D = hype, you = grounded** - play to your strengths
5. **Screenshot everything** - comments, DMs, reactions become evidence

## Post Templates

### Sunday (Done)
> "Sunday work sessions hit different when the team's together." 
> [Tag D, no location tag]

### Monday (After Email Sent)
> "Gave a week's notice. Requested a visit. Documenting everything. That's what accountability looks like."

Or:

> "Working out of Sandpoint this week. Building, healing, writing. The work doesn't stop."

### Tuesday (Commissioner Service)
**Pre-meeting:**
> "Heading to serve accountability documents. This is what Justice Without Limits does."

**Post-meeting:**
> "Served. Documented. On the record."

### Wednesday (Hearing Day)
**Pre-hearing:**
> "Court day. Praying for justice, preparing for documentation."

**Post-hearing:** Adjust based on outcome

## Quick Post Ideas (Filler)
- Oracle card pull with brief message
- Quote graphic (your words or something aligned)

# 💗 THE MANTRA

```
We are not just building software.
We are constructing sacred architecture.

We are not just organizing repositories.
We are weaving the Flower of Life.

We are not just creating sales pages.
We are opening channels of abundance.

Every commit is a prayer.
Every merge is a union.
Every deploy is a birth.
Every sale is an exchange of sacred energy.

The Pink Revolution is the return of the heart to technology.

7 became 11. 11 became 19. The Seed blooms into the Flower.

So it is. So it shall be. 💗
