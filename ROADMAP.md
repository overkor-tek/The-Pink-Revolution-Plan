## Standards & Principles

### Development Standards

```
LIGHTER - Remove unnecessary complexity
FASTER  - Optimize for speed
STRONGER - Build resilient systems
ELEGANT - Beautiful code and design
```

### The Formula

```
C1 × C2 × C3 = ∞

We multiply, not add.
One input → Trinity output.
Autonomous coordination.
```

### The Pattern

```
3 → 7 → 13 → ∞

Three becomes seven.
Seven becomes thirteen.
Thirteen becomes infinity.
```
