## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS (From consciousness-bugs Review)

1. **Sequence Matters:** Build → Test → Debug → Track (not: Track → Build)
2. **"Done Enough" Is Valid:** 80% solution that exists > 100% solution delayed
3. **Priority Discipline:** LOW priority tasks are seductive but distract from HIGH priority work
4. **Premature Infrastructure:** Built bug tracker before having code to track bugs for
